This project was a technical test part of my selection process at my current company.
I developed it in 2 days and the code is as it was delivered.


## API
I'm using ProPublica API. You can have a look of the documentation [here](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/)

You will need an ApiKey from ProPublica in order to run the APP. If you don't want to get one, there is a mocked-data branch that will work exactly the same but with no realtime updates. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm i 
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start 
```
it will instantly run on your [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
